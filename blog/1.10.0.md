### iOS Support

QtAV supports VideoToolbox for iOS. The decoding part is done by avcodec. What QtAV do is rendering the decoded frames. In this version, a new property `interop` is introduced in VideoToolbox decoder. It can be `CVPixelBuffer`, `CVOpenGLES`, `IOSurface` and `Auto`. `CVPixelBuffer` supports both iOS and OSX because it simply upload the frame plane data to textures, but data copy happened. `CVOpenGLES` is used by iOS and `IOSurface` is for OSX. No data copy. So it's faster than `CVPixelBuffer`. But there are some bugs that the rendering can fail when switching from sw decoder to VideoToolbox 0-copy mode, or toggling 0-copy mode.
